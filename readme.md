### Overview of DCENT

The Dynamically Consistent Ensemble of Temperatures (DCENT) is an ensemble of historical earth surface temperature estimates featuring sophisticated bias adjustments and comprehensive uncertainty quantification. It provides a cleaner picture for quantifying historical climate change at both global and regional scales, and for understanding climate variability and the dynamics behind it.

The development of DCENT builds upon a series of published papers and can be summarized into five steps, as indicated in the schematic below:

- (1) Homogenizing land station temperatures ([Chan et al., 2024b](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-23-0338.1));
- (2) Inferring near coast SSTs from homogenized coastal station temperatures ([Chan et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0569.1));
- (3) Groupwise SST comparisons (Chan and Huybers, [2019](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0562.1); [2021](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0907.1));
- (4) Correcting groupwise homogenized SSTs using inferred near-coast SSTs ([Chan et al., 2024a](Chan_et_al_2024_maintext.pdf));
- (5) Combining the land and ocean components.

### Installation Guide

1. Git clone this repository.
2. Change directories in ``dir_list.txt`` for individual sub data folders.
3. Change information in ``DCENT_config.sh`` according to your systems.  A list of parameters and their meanings can be found [here](#system-parameters).

### Reproducing DCENT
We recommend reproducing the analysis in the following order.  Note that we provide scripts for submitting jobs as .sh files.  Although we tried to use namelists to avoid modifying these scripts, certain modifications may be required to match up with specific SLURM versions.  

__When submitting jobs, ensure that you are in the correct sub-folder of code.__

#### A. Downloading and preprocessing ICOADS3.0
This step is in [ICOADS3_preprocess_NC](ICOADS3_preprocess_NC) and has four substeps:
1. __[Downloading data]__  In the command line, use the following to download data:
```
nohup ./download_ds548.0_1800s.csh  &
nohup ./download_ds548.0_1900s.csh  &
nohup ./download_ds548.0_2000s.csh  &
```
2. __[Preprocessing data]__  This includes finding the nation and SST method information, as well as calculating the winsorized mean in each 5-day 1-degree regrid boxes for Sea-Surface Temperature (SST) and Marine Air Temperatures (MAT).  In the command line, use the following:
```
./submit_Step_01_02.sh
```
3. __[Calculating Neighbor Std]__ This step calculates the standard error required for conducting buddy checks.
```
./ICOADS_NC_Step_03_Neighbor_std
```
4. __[Performing Buddy Check]__ This step finalizes the quality control of ICOADS datasets.
```
./submit_Step_04.sh
```

#### B. Group-Wise Intercomparison of SSTs

This step is in [SST_Intercomparison](SST_Intercomparison).  This analysis has been wrapped into a Shell script:
```
./ICOADS_monthly_update.sh
```

#### C. Land Station Temperature Homogenization

This step is in [SATH_V3](SATH_V3), which has 3 substeps:
1. __[Downloading data]__  Update to get the most recent version of GHCNmV4:
```
operational.sh
```
2. __[Homogenization]__ Perform the pairwise homogenization:
```
./Run_SATH_multiple_CPUs.sh GHCN auto 50 100  # The first 100 members
./Run_SATH_multiple_CPUs.sh GHCN GAPL 50 1000  # The second 100 members
```
3. __[Post-processing]__  Grid station-based temperature and calculate anomalies relative to the 1982--2014 climatology: 
```
./submit_GHCN3R_post.sh GHCN auto 50
./submit_GHCN3R_post.sh GHCN GAPL 50
```

#### D. Air & Ocean Intercalibration

This step is in [Air_Ocean_Intercomparison](Air_Ocean_Intercomparison), which has 2 substeps:

```
2. __[Generate DCENT]__ as the final product:
